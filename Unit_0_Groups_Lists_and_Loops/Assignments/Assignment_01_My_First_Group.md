## Unit 0, Assignment 1 - My First Group
Due: Friday, January 30th 2026

### Create a Group

1.  In your CMU Graphics canvas, create simple image composed of at least three shapes.

    *For example,* <br><img src = 'https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_Spring_2026/blob/main/Resources/Mobile_Phone.png'> 


2.  Save each shape to a variable.

    *For example,*

    ```python
    frame = Rect(130, 50, 140, 280, fill = 'darkBlue', border = 'Silver')
    screen = Rect(140, 70, 120, 220, fill = 'white')
    home_button = Circle(200, 310, 15, fill = 'grey')
    ```

3.  Group your shapes and assign your group to a variable.

     *For example,*

     ```python
     mobile_phone = Group(frame, screen, home_button)
     ```
     
  4. Create a folder for assignments in your portfolio titled `LastNameFirstInitial_Assignments`.
  5. Create a file in your assignments folder titled `LastNameFirstInitial_My_First_Group.py`
  6. Copy/Paste your code from the sandbox to `LastNameFirstInitial_My_First_Group.py`.
  7. Commit your work.

     **Remember to include an appropriate commit message**.
